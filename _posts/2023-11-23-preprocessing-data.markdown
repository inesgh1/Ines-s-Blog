## What to Expect:
Over the next 2 hours, we will delve into the intricacies of preprocessing numerical, categorical, text, and temporal data. Each section will be a blend of theoretical concepts and hands-on exercises, ensuring that you not only understand the 'why' but also gain practical experience with the 'how.'

Our goal is to empower you with the knowledge and tools to transform raw data into a valuable asset, enabling you to make informed decisions and build robust machine learning models.

## Let's Dive In:
So, without further ado, let's dive into the world of Data Preprocessing. Whether you're a seasoned data professional looking to refine your skills or a newcomer eager to unlock the mysteries of data, this workshop is tailored to meet you where you are.

Get ready to unravel the complexities, overcome challenges, and master the art of Data Preprocessing!

Let's begin the journey!
## What is Data preprocessing exactly ??
Data preprocessing is the process of transforming raw data into an understandable format. It is also an important step in data mining as we cannot work with raw data. The quality of the data should be checked before applying machine learning or data mining algorithms.

## Major Tasks in Data Preprocessing :

### 1.Data Cleaning :
 - **Handling Missing values** :Addressing the gaps in your dataset through techniques like imputation based on mean, median, or advanced machine learning models.
- **Outlier Management** : Identifying and managing outliers that might skew analysis and distort patterns.
- **Inconsistency Resolution** : Tackling inconsistencies in data entry, ensuring uniformity and reliability.
  ### 2.Data Integration :
Combining data from multiple sources is common in many analyses. Data wrangling includes integrating diverse datasets into a unified format, ensuring that they can be effectively analyzed together.
### 3.Data Reduction :
### 4.Data Transformation :
This involves scaling, normalizing, or transforming variables to meet the assumptions of statistical models or to improve the interpretability of the results.
  
## What is the best way to preprocess data with different types?
### 1.Numerical Data :
Numerical data is data that can be measured or counted, such as age, height, weight, income, or temperature. This type of data can be further divided into continuous or discrete, depending on whether it has a finite or infinite range of values. 
Preprocessing numerical data may involve scaling or normalizing the data to reduce the effect of outliers and different units of measurement. This can be done using min-max scaling, standardization, or robust scaling. Additionally, missing values can be handled by imputing them with a mean, median, mode, or a custom value. Alternatively, you can drop the rows or columns with missing values; however, this could result in losing valuable information. Lastly, dimensionality reduction techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) or linear discriminant analysis (LDA) can be applied to select the most relevant features and improve the performance and interpretability of the models.
